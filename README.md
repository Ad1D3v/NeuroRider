# NeuroRider

NeuroRider is a research-based project proposed mainly for creation of an effective autonomous motorcycle control system via reinforcement learning. The project will primarily focus on the brief study and implementation of a motorcycle-based agent in Unity Engine. The agent or the AI will be created for possessing and controlling the motorcycle so as to navigate it in the 3D world space environment provided. The agent will have to consider the different physical dynamics applied on a real-world vehicle and based on these parameters it will have to create an effective maneuvering for the motorcycle. The efficiency of the agent will be evaluated with the help of Tensorboard. The entire project primarily runs on Unity Engine for the simulation based training and result demonstration. It utilizes Unity ML Agents for some of the core ML mechanics.
